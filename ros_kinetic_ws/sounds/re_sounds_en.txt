intro-Hello! I am Nao. I am representing your customer and we will have a requirements elicitation interview now. Please follow the guides on the screen while talking to me. Let's start.
ending-Our interview is completed. Let me share your feedback. I will go over your each incorrect response and  I will explain what is the problem there. You can try again to select the appropriate response. Let's start.
conclude-Feedback session is also concluded. You can find the analysis in the screen. First of all, I observed you throughout the interview and analysed your facial expressions in terms of positivity and excitement. You can see the results per interaction in the first figure. Staying moderately positive and calm is highly important for successful requirement elicitation interviews. If your results are in greener areas you are good. Otherwise, you may need to practice more to gain behavioral control in the interviews. The second figure shows whether you choose the correct answer for each interaction. If you chose the wrong option, it is red . And if you chose proper option, it is green. If you corrected your mistake in the second try after getting the feedback, you can see it turns to green from red.  In the last figure, the number of mistakes per mistake class is shown.  Overall  It was a good job! I really enjoyed interviewing with you. Please follow the survey link sent in the chat to evaluate our conversation. Thank you !
